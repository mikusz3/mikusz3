<h1>RetroTVRaspberryPi</h1>

<p>This project uses the following components:</p>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4B 1GB</li>
<li>PC Remote</li>
<li>Server PC running Jellyfin and ErsatzTV</li>

<p>Have you ever wondered how to bring Jetix back on air, but without begging Disney for it? I did it!  
RetroTVRaspberryPi is a project that allows me to watch old TV channels that were once available in Poland when I was a kid.</p>

<p>I made it work — but it required a lot of thinking and figuring out how to use Jellyfin and ErsatzTV.</p>

<p>Just like I did, you can do it too. I’ll explain it in simple terms how I did it.  
Just please don’t ask me obvious questions — this tutorial is for those who are already somewhat familiar, not for people who won’t lift a finger.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To begin with, you’ll need to gather recordings of old shows and cartoons, especially those childhood favorites.</p>

<p>For legal reasons, I can't tell you where to find these recordings,  
but I suggest checking your drawers for old VHS tapes or DVDs.</p>

<p>Once you have the recordings, you’ll want to add them to Jellyfin.  
That part is pretty easy — and I’ll link some guides on how to set up Jellyfin if needed.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need to dive into ErsatzTV, which handles the creation of custom TV channels.</p>

<p>When it comes to ErsatzTV, I highly recommend watching chudy dredd’s video about “Dexter’s Hood Lab,”  
as well as his “Watching Old TV Channels (Jetix in 2024)” — both are full of useful info about ErsatzTV.</p>

<h2>ErsatzTV</h2>
<p>ErsatzTV is software that lets you create your own TV channels using recordings stored in Jellyfin.  
With it, you can make a channel that plays your favorite shows or cartoons in either random or planned order.</p>

<p>Think of it as FAST channels before FAST was a thing — but with more thinking involved about fillers, timing, and whatnot.</p>

<h3>Creating a Channel</h3>
<p>Start by creating a channel: assign it a number, upload a logo that shows up in the schedule and on-screen overlay.</p>
<p>Next, add your shows. If you've linked Jellyfin to ErsatzTV, it will automatically pull your media library.</p>

<h3>Managing Fillers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-Roll</strong> – I use this for station idents.</li>
  <li><strong>Mid-Roll</strong> – for breaks between episodes, though I don’t really use it.</li>
  <li><strong>Post-Roll</strong> – what plays after a program ends.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail</strong> – something to play before the next cartoon, e.g. ads or promos.</li>
  <li><strong>Fallback</strong> – a looping filler to fill in remaining gaps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Schedules</h3>
<p>In the Schedules section, you organize when each program airs.  
For me, I used scheduled shows with Post-Roll fillers ("Coming Up Next...") and Tail fillers (ads).</p>

<h3>Playout</h3>
<p>Playout is made by assigning a schedule to it, and optionally setting a fallback schedule too.</p>

<h2>The Final Result</h2>
<p>Once everything is working and your channels are created, you can enjoy retro TV  
by plugging it into Kodi and adding your ErsatzTV stream URLs.</p>

<p>The downside? You’ll need to keep your server PC on 24/7 — so you’ll need a compromise  
if you want your TV on your Pi instead.</p>

<p>In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi 4B 1GB connected to an old NORDMENDE Galaxy 36 TV via RF.  
To get it working, I just needed an RF antenna cable and an AV-to-RF converter.</p>

<p>And that’s basically it! I’m not sure what else to say, but if you want to talk,  
we can chat on Discord or via email.</p>
